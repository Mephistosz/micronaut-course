# Micronaut Course Project

This repository contains a Java project based on the [Udemy Micronaut Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-micronaut/). The project is built using the Micronaut framework, which is designed for building modular, easily testable microservices and serverless applications.

## Project Structure

This project follows the structure and best practices taught in the Udemy course.

- **src/main/java**: Contains the source code for the project.
- **src/test/java**: Contains the unit tests for the project.
- **build.gradle**: The Gradle build configuration file for dependencies and project settings.
